# Music-app

This is my music application. This app uses mainly: 
- Angular2
- TypeScript
- Spotify API
- json-server (REST API) -> database for playlists

To run this app, you must type "npm start" and then go to '\src\app' and type "json-server server-data.json" (if you have not this server you can install it by type: "npm install -g json-server").
Music app starts on 4200 port.
